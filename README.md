    <strong><em>Lit another Nix derivation</em></strong>
</p>

Bonfire is a slowly snowballing Nix flake with a collection of packages, NixOS modules and other cool things. 
Of course it contains personal NixOS configurations that use all of these stuff. 

The main goal of this project is to keep the structure as simple as possible but use the power of Nix language on maximum (a huge field of experiments, huh?). 

In any case, if you are already here, a great solution would be to first check the documentation for the project, where you can find useful information.

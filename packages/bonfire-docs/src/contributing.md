# Contributing

Just contribute and maybe there will be a contribution policy, maybe not. Nothing complicated, the same rules as everyone else, **just do it**.

Bonfire's main source is [Elnafo VCS](https://vcs.elnafo.ru/L-Nafaryus/bonfire), but you can also create issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/L-Nafaryus/bonfire).
